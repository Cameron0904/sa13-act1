            <p>Welcome to my blog, where I tell you the wild events that happens in my life. Last Thursday night, I think it was 14th, I was working my normal night shift job setting up rooms at an event space. It is pretty fast paced, since if we do not finish the set-up, then the client just does not get a set-up. But that is besides the point. I had gotten in a rush of sorts and tried to round a tight corner a little too fast. I had done it hundreds of times, but this time I had a weird angle and I jammed my finger into the door frame. It split my finger open and broke my finger aswell. This was an extremely "fun" experience, but now I have a broken finger. Woo hoo(not)! I will keep you guys updated and thanks for reading!</p>

            <p>These last few days have been rough. I keep hitting my finger on every single thing you could possibly think of lol. It is finally starting to heal again, but I really just can not wait to be able to bend it again. It feels like my knuckle is going to be stuck in a straight position forever haha. I should go back to the doctor in a few days, and I will give another update then. Cya later!</p>
