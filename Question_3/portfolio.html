        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>
            Hi, my name is Jack Joseph and I am a 29 year old man from the Denver, Colorado area.
            I come from a family of photographers, in which my mother and father loved to take me along for their professional photoshoots.
            I grew up in the small town Idaho Springs, Colorado, in which the beautiful scenery always garnered my attention.
            That is where my desire and drive to photograph really came from. 
            I love looking for the perfect shots, even in more extreme ways than many photographers would ever dream of.
            I tend to go all out with my photography in order to get the best piece of art I could possibly get out of a situation.
            I am a graduate from Brigham Young University with a Master's in Commerical Photography.
            Here are some of my big accolades I have recieved as a photographer:
            <ul>
                <li>1x Sony World Photography Award</li>
                <li>2x International Photography Awards(IPA)</li>
                <li>Monocrome Awards International Black and White Photography Contest Winner</li>
                <li>1x World Press Photo Award Recipient</li>
            </ul>
            I hope that this is just the beginning of a long list of awards in the near future. 
            I really value the end product of my work, and I know that you do too. 
            Feel free to reach out if you never need a photographer.
            I would love to meet you and the uniqueness that comes along with it!
